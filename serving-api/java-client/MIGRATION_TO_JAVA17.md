This document summarizes the changes made to migrate the Webex Contact Center AI Streaming Insight Java Client from Java 8 to Java 17.

## ðŸ”„ Changes Made

### 1. Build Configuration Updates

**File:** `build.gradle`
- Updated `java.sourceCompatibility` from `JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8` to `JavaVersion.VERSION_17`
- Updated `java.targetCompatibility` from `JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8` to `JavaVersion.VERSION_17`
- Updated Gradle wrapper version from `7.6` to `8.5` for better Java 17 support
- Removed unnecessary Dagger dependency that was causing build issues

### 2. Gradle Wrapper Configuration

**File:** `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
- Updated to Gradle 8.5 distribution
- Added `validateDistributionUrl=true` for security
- Ensures compatibility with Java 17+

### 3. Build Script Enhancements

**File:** `build.sh`
- Added strict Java 17+ version checking
- Build now fails early if Java 16 or lower is detected
- Improved error messages with guidance for Java installation

### 4. Documentation Updates

**Files:** `README.md`, `JAVA_SETUP.md` (new), `MIGRATION_TO_JAVA17.md` (new)

- **README.md**: Updated prerequisites to emphasize Java 17 requirement
- **JAVA_SETUP.md**: Comprehensive Java 17 installation guide for all platforms
- **MIGRATION_TO_JAVA17.md**: This migration summary document

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites After Migration

### Required
- **Java 17 or higher** (was Java 8+)
- Gradle 8.5+ (automatically handled by wrapper)

### Recommended Java Distributions
1. Eclipse Temurin (OpenJDK)
2. Amazon Corretto
3. Oracle OpenJDK
4. Red Hat OpenJDK

## ðŸš€ Benefits of Java 17

### Performance Improvements
- Significantly improved garbage collection with ZGC and G1GC enhancements
- Better memory usage and performance optimizations
- Enhanced JIT compilation with more aggressive optimizations
- Improved startup times

### Language Features
- Pattern matching for instanceof (Preview)
- Records for immutable data classes
- Sealed classes for restricted inheritance
- Text blocks for multi-line strings
- Local variable type inference (`var`) improvements
- Switch expressions with yield

### Security & Maintenance
- Long-term support (LTS) version with extended support until 2031
- Regular security updates and patches
- Modern cryptographic algorithms and TLS 1.3 support
- Improved memory management

### gRPC Compatibility
- Excellent compatibility with latest gRPC versions
- Superior HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support
- Enhanced TLS performance and security
- Better support for modern networking protocols

## ðŸ›  Development Environment Setup

### Before You Start
1. Uninstall or disable Java 8/11 if they conflict
2. Install Java 17+ using preferred method (see JAVA_SETUP.md)
3. Set JAVA_HOME environment variable
4. Verify installation with `java -version`

### IDE Configuration
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Set Project SDK to Java 17
- **VS Code**: Configure Java runtime to Java 17  
- **Eclipse**: Add Java 17 JRE and set as default

## âœ… Validation Steps

### 1. Check Java Version
```bash
java -version
# Should show 17.x.x or higher
```

### 2. Build the Project
```bash
./build.sh
# Should complete without Java version errors
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
./gradlew run
# Should start the interactive CLI
```

### 4. Generate Protocol Buffers
```bash
./gradlew generateProto
# Should generate classes without errors
```

## ðŸ”§ Backwards Compatibility

### Runtime Compatibility
- Java 17 bytecode is **NOT** compatible with Java 8/11 JVMs
- Applications must run on Java 17+ runtime after compilation

### Source Compatibility
- All existing Java 8/11 source code remains compatible
- Can optionally adopt new Java 17 features incrementally
- Records, sealed classes, and pattern matching available

### Dependencies Compatibility
- All project dependencies remain the same
- gRPC and Protocol Buffer versions unchanged
- Logging and JSON libraries unchanged

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes

### For Deployment
- **Java Runtime**: Must use Java 17+ in production
- **Build Systems**: CI/CD pipelines must use Java 17+
- **Docker Images**: Base images must include Java 17+

### For Development
- **Local Development**: Developers must install Java 17+
- **IDE Configuration**: Project settings must target Java 17

## ðŸ“ˆ Migration Checklist

- [x] Update build.gradle Java version settings to 17
- [x] Update Gradle wrapper to 8.5
- [x] Enhance build script with Java 17+ version validation
- [x] Update documentation and README
- [x] Create Java 17 installation guide
- [x] Test build process with version checking
- [x] Create migration summary documentation

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Install Java 17+** following the [JAVA_SETUP.md](JAVA_SETUP.md) guide
2. **Test the build** with `./build.sh`
3. **Update CI/CD pipelines** to use Java 17+
4. **Update deployment environments** to Java 17+
5. **Inform team members** about the Java 17 requirement

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter issues with the Java 17 migration:

1. Check the [JAVA_SETUP.md](JAVA_SETUP.md) installation guide
2. Review the troubleshooting section in [README.md](README.md)
3. Verify JAVA_HOME environment variable is set correctly
4. Ensure no conflicting Java versions in PATH

The migration maintains full backward compatibility for source code while providing the benefits of a modern, supported Java LTS version with enhanced performance and security.
